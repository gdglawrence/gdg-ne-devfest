# GDG

The following is Google Develper Group's statement about Google's support of the larger developer community.

***Connect beyond the screen***.

***When you join a Google Developer Group, you'll have the opportunity to meet local developers with similar interests in technology. A GDG meetup event includes talks on a wide range of technical topics where you can learn new skills through hands-on workshops. The community prides itself on being an inclusive environment where everyone and anyone interested in tech - from beginner developers to experienced professionals - all are welcome to join.***

## GDG NorthEast

GDG NorthEast is comprised of all the NorthEast GDG in the Eastern United States. This group is co-orangizing the Google Developer Group DevFest event virtually for the NorthEastern region in 2020. The DevFest is carefully crafted for you by your local GDG community to bring awesome speakers, great topics, and lots of fun! While no two events will be exactly alike, each GDG DevFest will, at its core, be powered by a shared belief that when developers come together to exchange ideas, amazing things can happen! The GDG community organizers also seek event sponsors to provide swags for event attendees.

GDG Leads are community developers who volunteer their personal time in supporting their local GDG community to share and to learn Google technologies with their community developers.
